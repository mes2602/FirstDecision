Decisions: 

maxWaves    The maximum number of waves it took for agents to either decide
                or run out of social information

numFDA      The actual number of accurate first decision counted so far
numFDW      The actual number of wrong first decisions counted so far

perFDA      Percent of trials with an accurate first decision
perFDW      Percent of trials with a wrong first decision
       10x3. 3: [FDA,FDW,combined]. 10 for waves; starts at first wave

wavesAcc    Records number of agents making accurate decision in each wave
wavesDec    Records number of agents deciding in each wave
wavesWrong  Records number of agents deciding wrongly in each wave

This is the uniform omniscient case. 
Thresholds for agents are drawn from the uniform distribution on [zMin, zMax].
Social updating following decisions is 'omniscient'; that is, every agent knows
every other agent's threshold and adjusts the social information from that other agent 
accordingly, so that an agent with a low threshold provides (perhaps) less social information
than an agent with a higher threshold.
